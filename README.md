# My-Fedora-KDE-Plasma-s-Workspace-
## Welcome to my tiny, precious workspace<sup>TM</sup>.
### (NOOB ALERT)

I will try to push here as much configs/dotfiles that I still achieve on my device as possible (this might includes files from other/older versions).

**A lot of them were not made by me, I just heavily modified it to my taste. You can open their README files and there's a very high chance you can see their original authors.\
I will never remove their credits!**

Also, never forget to:
```
sudo dnf update && sudo dnf upgrade
```
everytime you boot your precious Linux!

Trust me, this might help you in the future if some random annying bugs suddenly appear in your operating system.  
(Mine was PipeWire suddenly disconnected itself and couldn't be waken up)

> [!NOTE]
> **Feel free to use or modify these files without my permision[^1]! I would be even happy if you do that! :smile:**

### That's all!

[^1]: If you wanna contribute to this *baka* thing (I don't even think there will be a soul that know about my Github except me), please notify me, ok? (And hope I will read the notification :v)

Uh...I still wanna add more things to this README...\
Anyway, this is Hatsune Miku (my precious goddess)'s HEX color codes!

`#373B3E` `#BEC8D1` `#86CECB` `#137A7F`	`#E12885`  



> *"God dammit! Why can't you stop this long useless paragraph already?!"* 


### Okay okay ðŸ˜… That's actually all! Let's continue the journey!
